    <!--Give a brief explanation of your background and education-->
    <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:15px; text-indent: 20px;">
        Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Kendall and I am from a small town in Aurora, Utah. I graduated
    high school from North Sevier High School. I then went on to attend Southern Utah University and graduate with my
    bachelor's degree in Biology. I got married in 2014 and have two beautiful girls, age 6 and 4. We also have two dogs, Roscoe and Otto.</p>
        <p style="font-family:verdana; font-size:15px; text-indent: 20px;">After school I had a hard time applying my degree and ended up working for a company
    called CompHealth. I then decided I wanted to try and further my education and go back to school. I had always
    been interested in coding and technology so I decided to get a degree in software development. I applied to Grand
    Canyon University. Once accepted I decided to go through with it and get my bachelor's in software development. After
    school I'm hoping to join a company to gain experience and hopefully work my way up to a lead position. After I am
    hoping to build an app or start a project of some kind. </p>
